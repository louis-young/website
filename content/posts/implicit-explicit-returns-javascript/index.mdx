Today, we'll look at the difference between implicit and explicit <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return" target="_blank">returns</a> in JavaScript, dive into a few examples of these in action and explain what they do and how they work.

## What is a return statement?

> The `return` statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.

A basic example of a return is one used to stop function execution.

```js {4}
const greet = () => {
  console.log("Hello");

  return;

  console.log("World");
};

greet();
```

> Note: This return statement renders the code beneath it unreachable and is solely for example purposes.

This function will only log `"Hello"` to the console because the `return` prevents it from getting any further.

## Explicit returns

An explicit return is one which uses the `return` keyword explicitly, hence its name.

Explicit returns are used within the body of a function like so:

```js {4}
const greet = () => {
  console.log("Hello");

  return; // We can only use an explicit return here.

  console.log("World");
};

greet();
```

Let's see what an explicit return looks like with a simple arrow function.

```js
const greet = () => {
  return "Hello World";
};
```

> Note: This can be written on a single line, but we'll use multiple lines for this example.

And now let's look at what an explicit return looks like within a `map`.

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

const multipliedNumbers = numbers.map((number) => {
  return number * 2;
});

console.log(multipliedNumbers); // [4, 2, 6]
```

Now, let's take a look at these same examples using implicit returns.

## Implicit returns

Our first example can be rewritten to omit the curly braces and the return statement.

This is called an implicit return (because it returns without explicitly using a `return` statement) and looks like this:

```js
const greet = () => "Hello World";
```

Now, let's look at how we can clean up our `map` callback using an implicit return:

```js {3}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

const multipliedNumbers = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);

console.log(multipliedNumbers); // [4, 2, 6]
```

You may be wondering how to implicitly return an object as curly braces are also used to surround function bodies.

We can do this by wrapping our object in parenthesis:

```js
const foo = () => ({ bar: "Bar" });

console.log(foo()); // {bar: "Bar"}
```

## Mistakes

A common mistake for people who are new to React and JavaScript is forgetting to return components from a `map` in the return statement of their function component.

Here's an example of this:

```jsx
return (
  <ul>
    {items.map((item) => {
      <Component />;
    })}
  </ul>
);
```

Note that as the component is inside a function body, so this will _not_ work. If you are inside a function body, it must be explicitly returned like so:

```jsx {4}
return (
  <ul>
    {items.map((item) => {
      return <Component />;
    })}
  </ul>
);
```

Or implicitly returned by replacing the curly braces with parenthesis:

```jsx {3-5}
return (
  <ul>
    {items.map((item) => (
      <Component />
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```

## Conclusion

Hopefully this article helped you to understand implicit and explicit returns, and gave you some practical examples of how to utilise them in your JavaScript projects.
